I'm Arsenii, a dedicated software enthusiast with a primary focus on cybersecurity and low level coding. Currently studying for a Foundational Diploma in IT, I'm committed to expanding my knowledge and experience in the tech world.

I possess a strong command of Python. My familiarity with programming languages extends to C, Rust and Lua. My aspirations in the field are driven by an eagerness to contribute to cybersecurity and a genuine passion for coding.

My current endeavors include delving into the realms of penetration testing, ethical hacking, and reverse engineering. Additionally, I'm invested in the development of embedded systems such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Flipper Zero. Networking, firewalls, and scripting are areas that captivate my curiosity.

Furthermore, I have a keen interest in expanding my programming repertoire. While proficient in Python, I'm eager to explore bash scripting and delve into low-level languages like C++ or Rust. My enthusiasm for Linux and low-level programming adds another layer to my technical pursuits.
