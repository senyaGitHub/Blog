I'm a dedicated software enthusiast with a primary focus on cybersecurity and low-level coding. I have a passion for cybersecurity and prefer simplicity over complexity.

I know some Python, C, and Lua, and I'm currently studying Rust. I love single-board computers like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Flipper Zero.

Fell free to reach out.
